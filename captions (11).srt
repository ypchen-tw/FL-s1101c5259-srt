1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,359
according to my here on the row theorem

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
we know that

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,880
if language l

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,759
is recognized by a dfa with

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,759
k states

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
the language l has index

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,560
at most

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840
the key word a key word is at most here

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,039
k

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,880
and if you know that exactly

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,160
the index of l is k a finite number k

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,320
you know that

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,000
the language is recognized by a dfa with

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
k states

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
okay

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,640
so by

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,879
considering these two

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
results we know that

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
we know that

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,879
the the index of the language

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
the index of the language

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,280
is

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,559
exactly the size

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
of the smallest dfa

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,519
recognizing it

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,159
okay

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
because somehow you got the dfa

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,200
then

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
the dfa has like uh 100 states then you

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
know that

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,280
that language recognized by this dfa has

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,759
indexed at most 100 it may be less but

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,759
at most 100.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
if you already know

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,000
there is a language

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,320
has an index of like 50

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
then

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,560
then you know that

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
the smallest

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
as as in

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,439
fewest states

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,399
dfa recognizing that language

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,399
will be

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
50

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,880
states

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
okay

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,520
so

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,360
well firstly what is the situation of

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,079
more states

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,479
well it's like that for all strings

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,200
for example

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,959
all possible strings there is a maybe a

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,959
language classify all strings into like

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
let's say

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
five classes

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
five groups

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,160
then

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,840
for the corresponding dfa

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
maybe you have some

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
you know

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
equivalent states

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,760
then

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,959
after processing strings

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,440
let's say

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
dfa stops at

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
state 1

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,480
state 2

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
step 3

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
maybe

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
stop at state

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,800
4

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,800
and 5.

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
and the stop at

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,120
7 and 6.

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
it is possible

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
because

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
for the language

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
as the equivalency relation it can only

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
classify

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,879
all possible strings

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,920
into five classes but

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,200
in your dfa you may have more states

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
then

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,239
those those states

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,560
may be subclasses of

86
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
the class classified by the language

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
that is why if you find a dfa

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
recognizing in

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,319
a language l with k states

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
the index of the

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,120
language at the most is

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
at most k

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
so

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
here we want to

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,879
find out the equivalence

96
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
equivalent states

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,920
okay

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,400
so what is equivalent states don't

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,200
forget that when you see equivalent you

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,680
need firstly you need to check

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,000
what is the criteria judging the

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,120
equivalence okay

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,079
now we are talking about states of dfas

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
so we define that state p

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
and the state q

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
are said to be equivalent

107
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,120
if

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
for all strings

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,639
for all possible strings

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,680
you see start from p

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,880
and start from q

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
for the same string

113
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,479
they both goes to

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
[Music]

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
accept state or

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
another accept states

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,479
okay if and only if

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
so

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
if

120
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,040
start from p

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,560
processing string q

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
goes in

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
some

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
accept states

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,240
and

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,759
start from q

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,479
processing w also goes to accept

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:15,520
accept states or

129
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:19,120
they both goes to some non-accept states

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
if it's always so for all

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
possible strings

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
then we say that

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,160
the two states in that dfa are

134
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,320
equivalent

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
otherwise they are distinguishable

136
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
okay

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
and why we

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,039
why we define equivalence this way

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,759
equivalence of states this way

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,639
it's straightforward that because for

141
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,919
dfa processing strings

142
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,440
we only care about whether or not

143
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,680
after processing that string the machine

144
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,039
stop

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
on

146
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
some accept states or

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,240
not accept states right

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,039
so

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,759
on accept states stop and accept states

150
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,400
or stop at not

151
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
accept states

152
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
is our result

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,440
so we if

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,720
from start from p

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,360
and start from q

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,600
always

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
get the same result then they are

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
equivalent

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,680
right

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,000
so that's why the definition is written

161
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,000
in this way

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
so

163
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
for equivalent we need to check all

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
possible

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
strings

166
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,199
and if they

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
start from the two states always gate we

168
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,560
can always get the same results then we

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
say they are equivalent

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
on the other hand

171
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,000
we can try to do

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,240
finding distinguishable states

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
right

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,639
if we found some string to separate two

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,319
states then they are distinguishable

176
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,280
after we process all possible situations

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
then

178
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
those

179
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000
states

180
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,000
are not distinguishable they are

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
equivalent

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
so

183
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,800
we are

184
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,080
will be using a table filling algorithm

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
that's

186
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
given a dfa let's say a here

187
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:55,440
we use the following hydrogen to find

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,319
all distinguishable pairs in the dfa

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,879
okay

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
all the distinguishable pairs

191
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
firstly

192
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
if

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,440
any pairs

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
with one in the accept states and the

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
other

196
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,479
not in the accept states

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
such a pair

198
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,479
we know

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,199
in the beginning initially

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,400
is distinguishable

201
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,520
right

202
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,039
you can

203
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
consider that we use an empty string

204
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,280
here

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
to do the examination to do the check

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
start from for example if p

207
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
is in f

208
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,240
and the q is not enough

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,560
so processing

210
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
empty string

211
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,839
what you get

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,200
you get p here right which is in f

213
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,600
and you get q here which is not in f

214
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
so they are distinguishable

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
so

216
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,120
initially we know that

217
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,320
any pair between

218
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,800
accept states and not accept states

219
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,839
are distinguishable any pairs

220
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,360
okay

221
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,320
then think about that

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
if you already know that

223
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
a pair

224
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
of states

225
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,959
rs

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,560
is distinguishable you already know the

227
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,160
pair this pair is indistinguishable

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
and you go back

229
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
you go back

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,399
one symbol let's say

231
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
from p

232
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
process

233
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,959
a goes to r

234
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,080
from q process a the same symbol goes to

235
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,360
s

236
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,640
and

237
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
assuming that you already know r

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,959
s

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,480
is distinguishable

240
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,160
then

241
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
we know pq

242
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
is distinguishable

243
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
right

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
why because

245
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
the same reason here

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
start from p

247
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,040
you process a

248
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,399
you go to r

249
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,440
and start from q if you process a you go

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,040
to s

251
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,160
and since rs is distinguishable you know

252
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,160
that eventually processes some same

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
stream

254
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,640
you will get the results one of the

255
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
results here in f the other is not

256
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
right

257
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,880
so

258
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,519
we know that pq

259
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,519
is indistinguishable

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
okay

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,000
so that's what we have

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,000
on this one

263
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640
so we know that pq

264
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,959
is distinguishable if you already know

265
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,480
rs is distinguishable if because

266
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,399
for this

267
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,240
result and this result one of them

268
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
will get you

269
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,760
and accept states and the other of them

270
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
will not

271
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,600
okay

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
then

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,440
if we if we try to do

274
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,200
finding distinguishable pairs of

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,760
states of a dfa

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,760
it is possible

277
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:37,600
that we can find some equivalent state

278
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,680
of some dfa of the given dfa then

279
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,000
we can

280
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,720
reduce the number of states of that dfa

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,480
that's why we called this process

282
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,920
minimizing

283
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,440
a dfa

284
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,040
and you actually can find the

285
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,279
this detailed algorithm on our textbook

286
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
as

287
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
a problem

288
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,360
725

289
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
on page

290
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
324 to 325

291
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,600
the

292
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,839
740 here is for the uh second version

293
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,200
second edition sorry second edition of

294
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,519
the textbook and the number here is for

295
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,399
third edition okay

296
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,639
so no matter which edition you are using

297
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,959
it contains all the materials we will

298
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,920
cover uh this semester

299
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
okay

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,360
so

301
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,360
that's uh

302
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
do an example

303
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
as the

304
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
how the

305
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,880
minimizing

306
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,880
process go

307
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,279
so given the dfa here

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,920
given a dfa here

309
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,920
you can see that

310
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
let me

311
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,959
okay uh for the

312
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,760
example dfa we have eight stated here

313
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,000
and uh only one accepted and the other

314
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,639
seven are not accepted

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,399
okay so c is the only accept states

316
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
of the dfa

317
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,440
and according to the table of building

318
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,480
algorithm we need to construct our bases

319
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,040
the basis is that initially we know that

320
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,920
the pairs are distinguishable and for

321
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
this example we know that

322
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
uh

323
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:55,440
well c a c b c d c e c f c g

324
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,320
c h the seventh pair here

325
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
are distinguishable so

326
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,839
let's

327
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
mark them

328
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,720
here

329
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
so

330
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,839
c a

331
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
c b

332
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
c d

333
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
c e

334
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,279
c f

335
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
c g

336
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,279
c h

337
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,480
they are

338
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
initially

339
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
distinguishable

340
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
pairs of states

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,440
okay

342
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,680
then we try to use the uh

343
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
algorithm to find

344
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,320
all other

345
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,279
pairs distinguishable pairs

346
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,040
so uh imagine that the process is like

347
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,040
you have

348
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,839
let's say cue

349
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,839
to help the whole process and whenever

350
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,440
you find a new

351
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,399
pair a new distinguishable pair you

352
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,440
append to the end of the queue and then

353
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,160
you pop one in front of the queue

354
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
to process

355
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,639
okay to process that pair

356
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,600
so in this case initially we have the

357
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
seven pair here so we

358
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,560
push

359
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,600
ca into the queue cb into a queue etc

360
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,040
then we start to do the iteration

361
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,680
then firstly we pop one pair one

362
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
known distinguishable pair out of the

363
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,079
queue

364
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,079
so we got ca

365
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,480
right

366
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,720
so now we are processing c

367
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,279
a

368
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,639
okay so when process is ca what we want

369
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,120
to do is that we check

370
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
we check

371
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
which state

372
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,959
the

373
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,880
symbol 0 goes to c and which states goes

374
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,320
to a

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,120
okay so via symbol 0 that would be

376
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
goes to c that'll be d and f right

377
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,639
symbol zero here

378
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
and we know that

379
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
d

380
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,160
and f for c

381
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,360
and for a that'll be

382
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
c

383
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
right c

384
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
so

385
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,240
three uh sorry two pairs here now b

386
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,920
dc

387
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
standard cd

388
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
and

389
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,279
fc

390
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,079
they are not new pairs because they are

391
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,880
already waiting in the queue

392
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
right

393
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,519
so waiting here

394
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,920
and

395
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,800
here they are waiting

396
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,680
then

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,279
it it's for symbol zero then for symbol

398
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,680
one what what is that for symbol one

399
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
for c that will be b

400
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
c

401
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
h

402
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,360
right

403
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,000
but for a nothing

404
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,519
so since nothing here there's no pair

405
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,640
here

406
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,439
okay we already processed

407
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
ca the first pair and

408
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
no new

409
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
information found

410
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,679
then

411
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,839
we processed ca here

412
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,839
then

413
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,400
c

414
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,480
b

415
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
right

416
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,720
okay the same thing

417
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,600
uh check symbol zero so for c that'll be

418
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840
d

419
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
f

420
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,039
for b

421
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
for b that will be

422
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,799
a

423
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
right

424
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,559
because you see

425
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,440
from a

426
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,120
symbol zero to b so

427
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,039
a will go to b be a symbol zero

428
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,039
so there will be d a

429
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
and

430
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
f a

431
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,520
or

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,760
adaf okay that's the same

433
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
so

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
we know that

435
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,559
a d and

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
af

437
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,840
okay

438
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,240
then symbol one

439
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,679
for c

440
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,640
that would be b

441
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,320
c h

442
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,520
for b

443
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,520
no

444
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,799
so no pair

445
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:41,120
see so in this round we got two new

446
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,120
distinguishable distinguishable pairs

447
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,200
adaf

448
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
okay

449
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,120
then

450
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,799
cb is processed so let's record it

451
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
cb is processed

452
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,320
and

453
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,320
we got

454
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,559
the

455
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,919
8

456
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,240
and

457
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,360
adf 9 here

458
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
okay

459
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
so next

460
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
we

461
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,640
pop out

462
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
cd

463
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
right

464
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
c

465
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,919
d

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,720
and same thing 0 so for c

467
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,160
that will be d f

468
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
for d

469
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,039
no

470
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,080
so no pair

471
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,080
and symbol one

472
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,440
there will be states b c h

473
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
for d

474
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
no so no

475
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,760
then

476
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,320
cd is processed

477
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,679
and no new information generated okay

478
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,440
so

479
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,880
here

480
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,240
then

481
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,240
next one ce

482
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
c

483
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,080
e

484
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
right

485
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,760
so symbol zero symbol one

486
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,760
d f

487
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,080
no

488
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,039
so no

489
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,960
right

490
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,840
and the symbol one

491
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
b

492
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,559
c

493
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,039
h

494
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,440
and for e

495
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,720
there's a g here

496
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
right there's a g here

497
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,120
so we got

498
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,360
bg

499
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,799
three pairs okay c g

500
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
and h

501
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,360
g

502
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
three pairs

503
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,679
but we know that c g

504
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,520
is waiting in the queue

505
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,799
right here so it's not a new information

506
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,360
we got two new new pairs the first one

507
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
is bg

508
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,960
bg where's bg here

509
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
that'll be 10

510
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,760
and hg

511
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,799
right hg

512
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
that'll be

513
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,760
here 11

514
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,880
okay

515
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
so

516
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
then

517
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
the pair ce is processed

518
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,600
so we

519
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
mark that this is proposed processed

520
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,679
we got

521
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
here

522
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,840
and here

523
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,840
okay

524
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,600
then next one

525
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,120
we pop we pop

526
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
cf

527
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,159
from the queue

528
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,480
cf from the cube and the check symbol

529
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
zero

530
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,799
when check symbol zero

531
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,440
for c

532
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,799
d f will go to c beer 0 and the 4 f

533
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,200
nothing

534
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,720
so no pair here

535
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
for symbol 1

536
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
b

537
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,360

e

540
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,039
right so there will be six pair out of

541
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,159
the situation here

542
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
so there will be a b

543
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,799
oh let's say ba then b e

544
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,559
then

545
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,360
c a

546
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,440
then

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
then h a

549
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,360
then h

e

551
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,520
and

552
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,240
after checking you know that ca

553
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,600
is the first pair we processed so no new

554

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360

what a b

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
is one

563
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,760
and

00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,760

565
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720

720
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,039
new distinguishable pairs

721
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,159
then

722
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,640
we need to still process

723
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,240
all these pairs one by one

724
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
until our queue

725
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,399
becomes empty

726
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,480
okay so we need to process all

727
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,559
pairs

728
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,520
until the queue is empty

729
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,039
so

730
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,120
of course that state

731
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,000
now we process the number

732
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
eight

733
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,559
okay

734
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,760
number eight here that will be a d

735
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
right

736
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,399
so process a d

737
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,880
you will find that

738
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,840
a d here

739
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,000
and the symbol 0 symbol 1.

740
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
for symbol 0 a

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,640
c

742
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,840
goes to a via 0 and for d there will be

743
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,679
no pair

744
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
so nothing here

745
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,480
okay

746
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,000
and for

747
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,399
symbol one

748
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
nothing for a so no pair okay so 80

749
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,679
processed

750
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,320
okay ad

751
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,120
processed

752
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,200
then

753
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,200
for

754
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,039
af

755
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,799
for f

756
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,159
let's go this way

757
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,120
af symbol 0

758
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,519
c

759
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,519
right and for f symbol zero

760
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,919
nothing

761
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,799
so no pair

762
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,600
no pair and symbol one

763
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,720
a

764
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,080
no pair

765
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
nothing

766
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,640
and so

767
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:45,039
no pair so nine processed

768
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,039
then we pop 10 right pop 10.

769
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,360
for 10 here that would be bg

770
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,679
and

771
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,559
we know that for symbol 0

772
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,559
for symbol 0

773
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,519
b will be a

774
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,399
and for

775
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,919
uh g symbol zero

776
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,640
will be b

777
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,919
g

778
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,480
h

779
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,480
then we will get three pairs right a b

780
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,320
a g

781
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,159
and a

782
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,679
h

783
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:25,600
okay so

784
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,799
a b is uh 12 right the the 12 12 pair so

785
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,159
not new

786
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:34,559
information waiting in a queue and a g

787
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,559
yes c a g is a

788
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,200
is a new pair so that'll be 23

789
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,080
should be correct right 23 here

790
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,000
and then

791
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,679
it's new ah edge is 14 waiting for

792
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,960
processing so

793
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,519
new

794
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,679
information and symbol one

795
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:04,080
so symbol one for b is empty so no pair

796
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,200
then we processed the tenth

797
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,320
here

798
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
okay

799
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,440
then

800
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,679
the eleventh

801
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,080
pair popped

802
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
that will be

803
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,240
gh

804
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,559
oh or hg right g h

805
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,679
then symbol 0

806
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
for symbol

807
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,760
0 g

808
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,720
[Music]

809
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
is b g h

810
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,799
and

811
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,200
for h that'll be e

812
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,840
o okay so you see

813
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
b e

814
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,039
g e

815
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
h e

816
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,080
okay

817
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
h e

818
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,840
so what is b e

819
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,279
be is uh 13

820
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,399
pair 13

821
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,480
so

822
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,240
waiting in the queue

823
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
and ge

824
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,440
is actually new so

825
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,919
24

826
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,960
all right 24

827
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,000
then

828
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,879
h e

829
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,879
h e is

830
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,679
uh

831
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,320
15 so 15

832
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,200
not the new information within the queue

833
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,800
and symbols are simple one for symbol

834
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,000
one g

835
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,720
is

836
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,119
a single one

837
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,119
df

838
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,639
for h symbol one known

839
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,599
so no pair generated okay

840
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,280
so

841
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,879
we now processed 11

842
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,839
pairs

843
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,520
okay

844
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,639
and frankly we need to process you see

845
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,280
12

846
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,480
13 14

847
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,240
15

848
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,839
and go on

849
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,800
and until 23

850
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,560
24

851
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
24th

852
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
that is

853
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,160
on the table here we discovered all

854
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,520
distinguishable pairs

855
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,480
okay

856
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,920
so

857
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,760
of course i already did everything so we

858
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
i know that there will be no new

859
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,320
information

860
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,000
in a later stage but you can do that as

861
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,599
a practice

862
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and

863
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,000
it need

864
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,480
need you need to pay attention to

865
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,200
details otherwise you may

866
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,000
miss something okay you may repeat the

867
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,280
whole

868
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,720
process uh from start okay just

869
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
for a practice

870
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
so

871
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,119
finally we get

872
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,119
it doesn't really matter about the uh

873
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,119
odors or all the marks we did here

874
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,800
it only matters when

875
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,800
we find

876
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,880
you know those x marks in the

877
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,880
in the table as shown here

878
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,599
okay

879
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,160
so

880
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,160
now we know that

881
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,359
now we know that

882
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,119
all the

883
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,640
uh

884
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,920
all the distinguished

885
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,920
distinguishable pairs of the dfa has

886
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,640
been found

887
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,200
that is for example

888
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,200
hg

889
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,560
for example hg here

890
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,240
and the edge here

891
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,480
etc they are distinguishable pairs

892
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
so

893
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
what we

894
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,800
need to

895
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
look at is

896
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,000
any unmarked

897
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,000
pairs

898
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
so for example

899
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,520
this is unmarked this space is a marks

900
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,480
and this one

901
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,560
they are what they are a e

902
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
they are bh

903
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,560
and

904
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,000
df okay three pairs

905
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,480
so that means

906
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,520
ae

907
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,280
in this dfa ae

908
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,720
bh and df are

909
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,160
equivalent state pairs

910
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,440
okay

911
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,200
so

912
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,280
by definition

913
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,280
we can actually

914
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,280
merge

915
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,240
a e

916
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,400
b h

917
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,839
and

918
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
df

919
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,320
okay

920
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,320
we can do that

921
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,200
and remember that

922
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,359
when after you find

923
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,040
the equivalent

924
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,920
state pairs

925
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,000
and

926
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,920
if you decide to merge

927
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,880
if you decide to merge the equivalent

928
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,800
states you have to

929
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,839
merge

930
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
all these pairs

931
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,079
at once

932
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,880
in a single stage you cannot say that

933
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,920
okay i merge ae first and and i don't

934
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
want to

935
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,320
merge b

936
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,359
h and df that doesn't work why because

937
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,400
you see

938
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,560
if you only want to merge ae in this

939
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,880
case

940
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,880
in this

941
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,359
case for zero

942
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,599
okay for zero

943
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,800
you want to merge a e for in this case

944
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,920
for zero

945
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,920
a goes to b

946
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,000
right symbol zero a goes to b

947
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,000
and for symbol zero e goes to h

948
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,119
right

949
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,359
then you don't know

950
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,040
uh if you only want to merge a e without

951
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,040
merging bh

952
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,359
and df

953
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,160
then it creates

954
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,160
a problem for dfa that

955
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,640
after merge let's say this is one state

956
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,400
called a e

957
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,000
and when c in symbol 0 where do you want

958
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,880
to go

959
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,599
since you don't want to merge b and h

960
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,760
then for symbol 0 you don't know

961
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,079
you need to go b or

962
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,119
go edge you can only go one way right

963
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,079
that's the way of dfa

964
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:08,640
that's why it doesn't work that if you

965
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,640
don't you only want to merge partial

966
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,440
uh

967
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
equivalent states pairs

968
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,040
you either

969
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,760
merge then

970
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,319
o

971
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,520
otherwise you don't merge any of them

972
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,880
okay so that's the issue here

973
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,440
if you merge

974
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,599
each pair of equivalent states then

975
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,760
there's no problem why

976
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,440
because you can see that

977
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,319
if you merge a

978
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,839
also bh also df

979
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,040
then

980
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,359
for

981
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,040
ae

982
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,680
and the symbol zero

983
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,680
it goes to one state which is bh

984
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,319
right that's one state because you need

985
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,640
to merge b and h

986
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,640
and

987
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,319
and

988
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,319
that will be

989
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,359
so let's see uh what

990
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,040
happened if we

991
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,920
merge all the

992
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,760
equivalent states we have found okay

993
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,079
so that'll be the next page like this

994
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,440
so you will see that there will be no

995
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
problem here

996
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,839
that

997
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,520
you have

998
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:34,760
one state for a and e one state for d

999
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,760
and f and one state for b edge

1000
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,920
so uh in this case we

1001
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:41,280
[Music]

1002
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,560
well

1003
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,440
merged three pairs so

1004
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,440
eight

1005
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
state

1006
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,319
become

1007
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
five

1008
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,520
state

1009
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,720
okay so that'll be the minimization of

1010
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,560
dfa

1011
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,079
and you can find

1012
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,359
uh you can find the detailed

1013
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,599
algorithm

1014
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,000
on third edition

1015
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,400
textbook third edition

1016
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,400
page

1017
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,040
three two four two three 2 5 which is

1018
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,839
problem

1019
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:27,280
7 25 problem 721 okay

1020
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,280
so that's it for uh chapter one regular

1021
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,280
languages

1022
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,400
you
